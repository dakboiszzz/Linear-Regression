# Gradient Descent
My first gradient descent implementation

The objective is to find the minimum of a specific function (in this case it's quadratic which makes things easier). 

I calculated the partial derivatives and start to "descent" with a learning rate.

I plotted the graph and the path in matplotlib (but I have to ask AI for that part).

This is my first step towards AI/ML !
